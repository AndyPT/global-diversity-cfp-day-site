              - During the global event in January 2020, incidents were reported at three of our workshops where attendees displayed exclusionary behaviour
              - In two of these instances, after discussion, the group was satisfied that the handling of the issue was sufficient. In the third, the offender was asked to leave as they had not demonstrated willingness to comply with the CoC.
