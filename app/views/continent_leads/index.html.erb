  <h3>Content</h3>
  This is expected to follow the same rough path as the existing workshop format:
  <ul>
    <li>CFP Advice</li>
    <li>How to figure out what attendees should be talking about?</li>
    <li>Putting together a biography</li>
    <li><%= link_to "Caring for Your Audience ðŸ”— ðŸ’›", "#caring-for-your-audience" %></li>
    <li>Structuring a Talk</li>

    <li>How to prepare for the day of your talk</li>
  </ul>

  Feel free to include:
  <ul>
    <li>Building on the "Caring for Your Audience" session, by having an educational talk focussed on understanding how descrimination affects people,  for example due to racism or transphobia. </li>
    <li>A generic fun (tech?) talk</li>
    <li>Games using <a href="https://kahoot.com/">Kahoot? ðŸ”—</a></li>
  </ul>



  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h4 id="caring-for-your-audience">Caring for your audience</h4>

  Here you will need a group of people (panel?) that are from a mixture of backgrounds, and are comfortable participating.
  Please explain the format upfront.

  <b>Part 1: Content / Trigger Warnings</b>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Ask participants to provide examples of Content / Trigger Warnings that attendees should have before their future talks?
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, ask the group to discuss "Why" each item raised is potentially triggering and important share upfront.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <b>Part 2: Inclusive Language / Behaviour</b>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Ask participants to provide examples from their experience of language or behaviour they find exclusionary?
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, ask the group to discuss "Why" each item raised is exclusionary and what is a more inclusive thing to say or do.
    </li>
  </ol>



  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h4 id="interview-past-attendees">Pre-record interviews with past attendees:</h4>

  The aim here is to promote successful past attendees and their speaking journey and CFP Day's role in that journey:

  Interviews could focus on:
  <ul>
    <li>What is their story/journey?</li>
    <li>What role did CFP Day play in your journey?</li>
    <li>How have their feelings changed when applying to speak / putting together a talk / delivering a talk?</li>
    <li>Has anything changed in their career since beginning that speaking journey</li>
  </ul>

  Once edited, these can be used in a number of places:
  <ol>
    <li>Part of any continents stream</li>
    <li>Promotion on the website and social media</li>
    <li>Each vi.to hub has a landing page a few days before the event begins with a video playing welcoming attendees</li>
  </ol>
