<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  A 16 year old inspired me to learn to code.
</p>
<p>
  This lit the fuse that would take me on an amazing journey through challenges and victories while creating an app to help victims escape domestic violence and abuse.
</p>
<p>
  This is my story.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This is the story of how someone with no coding experience got their app approved for the app store.
</p>
<p>
  There were challenges along the way which were far outweighed by the success, impact and achievements.
</p>
<p>
  Since its release the social impact of the application has been incredible.
</p>
<p>
  Then a global technology giant came knocking, which brought a new life of excitement as well as being completely overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
  This story serves as an example of why women should be recognised as an equal and important part of the tech community.
</p>
<p>
  Come meet the Oprah of technology.
