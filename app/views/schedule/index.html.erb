  <h4>All suggestions and contributions are welcome, feel free to deviate from this (or the final schedule) in your workshop. </h4>

      <td>
        The lovely folks at @WomenTalkDesign are putting together a video to introduce this activity.
        <br/>
        People don't like writing about themselves. Rather than have attendees introduce themself, they will pair up and interview each other and put together the other persons Bio.
        <br/>
        Once that is done folks will present/introduce their pair to the group.
