  <h2>Announcement:</h2>
  <h2>Global Diversity CFP Day partners with QueerJS & VueVixens</h2>
  <p>
  Since the 2019 event we have been keen to give our attendees a clear continuation path with known, trusted groups for attendees to give a talk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today we are incredibly excited to announce two super-powered, front end, distributed events that are here to support you in taking that next step by providing an opportunity to giving a talk in a safe, positive, encouraging environment.
