    <h2>Saturday 3rd February 2018</h2>
    On Saturday 3rd February 2018 there will be numerous workshops hosted around the globe encouraging and advising newbie speakers to put together your very first talk proposal and share your own indivdual perspective on any subject of interest to people in tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each workshop will have experienced speakers on hand to:
    <ol>
      <li>give you a warm, inclusive welcome in a safe space (check out our <%= link_to "Code of Conduct", code_of_conduct_path %> which all participants must adhere to)</li>
      <li>mentor you with your proposal</li>
      <li>provide speaking advice</li>
      <li>and share their enthusiasm to get you to the stage!</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    <h2>What do you need to do next?</h2>
    Sign up to a <a href="#cities">workshop at a location</a> near you and, if you have one, bring a laptop along to submit that proposal. If you have a spare laptop bring it along incase it can help someone else.
  </p>

  <p>
    <h2>Subject Matter</h2>
    These workshops have no specific language, framework or process as a focus. Even if your talk isnâ€™t even related to tech we want to hear from you too! In short, if there is something that you want to shout to the world we're here to help you get there regardless of the boundaries of technology or communities.
